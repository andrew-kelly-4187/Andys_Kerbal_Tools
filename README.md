# Andys Kerbal Tools
This repo will be a holding pen for any documents I write, or tools I build, to aid in my experience of Kerbal Space Program. I'm hoping this will include PDF's of key formulae in astrodynamics, as well as dashboards for calculating dv. We'll see what I come up with.

If you wanna use these go for it. Fill your boots. I'm just doing this to 1) Keep my stuff in one place, 2) Practice this github malarkey, and 3) Get me practicing languages such as R and python.
